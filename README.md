The file stock_stats.vbs's entire contents can be copied into a module for either the alphabetical_testing or Multiple_year_stock files once they are converted to macro enabled books by saving them as xlsm files.
Paste the code in and then run it on either book and it will go through the sheets, process them and create the required stats info.
